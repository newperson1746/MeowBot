# CMU PRISM Discord Bot

This is the source code for the Discord bot from CMU PRISM's Discord, lovingly forked from upstream @spjy 's Homework Help Discord bot (https://github.com/spjy/hwh-bot). 

Thank you Spencer and the rest of the HWH staff team for the amazing community I continue to serve to this day throughout all these years, and which has granted me the foundation for any Discord bot I code, lol
